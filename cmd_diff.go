// diff shows what rendering would change, against the manifests as

// It used to compare against the GitOps repo, back when a service's
// manifests were copied there by hand. They are not: Argo reads each
// service's deploy/ directory from the service's own repo, and the
// GitOps repo holds only argocd.json. Comparing against it meant every
// manifest came back "(new)" for a service that was deployed and
// running - four false differences out of five outputs on pokedex - and
// the empty case printed "up to date" about a directory holding one
// JSON file, which reads as a statement about the deployment.
//
// Comparing against deploy/ here makes it a real check again: the same
// question `render` + `git diff --exit-code` asks in CI, answerable
// before committing.
