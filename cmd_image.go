// imageCmd prints the registry path this service publishes to.
//
// It exists so the CI workflow can ASK for the image name instead of
// remembering it. The name used to be written twice: into config.yaml,
// which reaches the manifests through every `render`, and into the
// workflow's `images:` line, which `init` wrote once and never
// revisited. Only the first followed a rename, so CI published under one
// name while the cluster pulled another - and nothing said so. The build
// was green, because it pushed an image successfully. `render` was
// clean, because the manifests matched the config. Argo reported Synced,
// because it applied what it was given. The only symptom was
// ImagePullBackOff, and on a first deploy there is no previous image to
// fall back to, so the service simply never started.
//
// One line of output and nothing else, because the caller is a shell:
//
//   - id: image
//     run: echo "ref=$(./homelabctl image)" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
//
// No tag. The workflow's metadata-action owns tagging, and this answers
// only "what is this image called".
//
// This does NOT couple the deploy plane to the build plane. The fact
// lives in config.yaml, which both already read; render is untouched,
// and internal/render and internal/runtime still do not import each
// other. What changes is that the workflow holds a question rather than
// a copy of the answer.
