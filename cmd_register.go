// register tells Argo about a service, by opening a PR on the GitOps
// repo that adds its argocd.json.
//
// Its own command rather than `render --register`, which it used to be.
// That flag made 30% of runRender a block that wrote no files and made
// one network call to a different repository - three unrelated effects
// (write manifests locally, produce a registration record, open a
// cross-repo PR) sharing nothing but an in-memory slice that two lines
// recompute.
//
// The flag combinations are what settled it. `--dry-run --register` was
// accepted and silently did nothing, because --dry-run returns before
// render.All is called: a rehearsal of registration that rehearsed
// nothing and exited 0. `--force` gated registration on preflight,
// which inspects the live Deployment - unrelated to registering.
// `--out` wrote manifests somewhere else while the PR still carried the
// git-derived path. Separate commands delete all three rather than
// documenting them.
//
// argocd.json is still rendered by render.All, deliberately: it is
// enumerated by kustomization.yaml's resourceNames, so moving it to
// another package would turn a same-package call into a cross-package
// dependency. Keeping it there is what makes this command two lines.
