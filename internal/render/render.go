// Package render turns a config into Kubernetes manifests and the Argo
// Application. Nothing here is language-specific: a Go service and a Node
// service produce identical manifests given identical config.
//
// # If a second deployment target is ever added
//
// This package IS the Kubernetes target. The intended shape for a second
// one - Terraform for an AWS deploy, say - is a sibling package with the
// same signature, config -> []Output, chosen by a `deploymentTarget:`
// field in config.yaml. Output{Path, Body} is already target-neutral: a
// .tf file is text with a path.
//
// No interface until that second target is real code. Go's implicit
// satisfaction means one can be lifted out of these function signatures
// later with no edits here, so declaring one now would buy nothing and
// fix the wrong methods - internal/runtime is the cautionary example,
// where a Runtime interface written for "the runtime that eventually
// needs more than data" still has exactly one implementation.
//
// What the config would need, from an audit of the current schema:
//
//   - Portable as-is: name, team, runtime, kind, image, port, env,
//     secrets (the NAME: property shape maps onto Secrets Manager's
//     JSON-key selector almost exactly), probes.path.
//   - Kubernetes-only: namespace, hardened, metrics, ingress.authelia,
//     and above all patches/overrides - keyed by Kubernetes resource
//     Kind and generated filename, so they have no AWS meaning at all.
//     These belong under a `kubernetes:` block if the config ever
//     grows per-target sections.
//   - Does not survive translation: resources. Fargate sells discrete
//     (cpu, memory) pairs - 256 CPU units allows only 512/1024/2048 MiB
//   - so a 10m CPU request has no expression there at all; the floor
//     is 0.25 vCPU. replicas is clean for ECS desiredCount and
//     meaningless for Lambda, whose nearest concept is a concurrency
//     ceiling rather than a target. schedule is a trap: Kubernetes uses
//     5-field cron, EventBridge 6-field with a mandatory year, so
//     "0 3 * * *" is not valid there.
//
// The discipline that keeps this from becoming a lowest-common-
// denominator schema: the shared core shrinks when a target is added,
// never grows, and a target is allowed to REFUSE a config rather than
// invent a mapping - `hardened: true` means runAsNonRoot, drop ALL and
// a seccomp profile, and Fargate offers almost none of that, so a
// silent partial mapping would be a security lie. Refusing is the same
// instinct as ShadowedPatches and UnknownOverrides here.
//
// Per-target validation needs no new machinery: config.Schema is JSON
// Schema, and if/then/allOf on a `deploymentTarget:` discriminator lets
// one document require the aws block for aws targets, forbid it for
// kubernetes, and constrain cpu to Fargate's legal values. Verified
// against santhosh-tekuri/jsonschema v6, the compiler Load already
// uses, and Load validates the raw document BEFORE decoding - which is
// what makes conditional validation possible, since defaulting erases
// the difference between an omitted key and a rejected one.
