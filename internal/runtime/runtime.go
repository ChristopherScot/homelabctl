// Package runtime is the extension point for languages.
//
// A Runtime knows the things that differ per language - how to build, what
// base image to run on, what source files a new service starts with - and
// nothing else. Everything downstream (Kubernetes manifests, the Argo
// Application, the image-updater annotations, CI) is identical regardless
// of language and lives in the render package.
//
// Adding a language is normally NO Go code: a directory under templates/
// holding its Dockerfile, steps.yaml, workflow.yaml and starter files,
// plus one embedded{...} entry in registered.go. All three shipped
// runtimes are exactly that.
//
// The Runtime interface exists for the runtime that eventually needs more
// than data - one whose build steps depend on inspecting a lockfile, say.
// That one can be its own type and Register itself, instead of becoming a
// special case inside embedded. Note embedded's fields are unexported and
// this package is internal, so implementing Runtime means adding a type
// HERE, not from another module.
