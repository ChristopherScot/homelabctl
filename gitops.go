// Registering a service with Argo.
//
// A service's manifests live in its own repo and Argo reads them there,
// but the ApplicationSet's generator reads argocd.json from the GitOps
// repo - a generator has exactly one repoURL. So one small file has to
// land there, and copying it by hand was the step people forget: the
// service is built, pushed and green, and nothing is deployed because
// nobody remembered the copy.
//
// This opens a pull request rather than committing. Adding a service to
// the cluster is a cluster change, and it gets reviewed like one - the
// same reason app-of-apps syncs with selfHeal but not prune.
